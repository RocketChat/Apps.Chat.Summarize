Summarize the above dialogue by topics.

Only messages that are relevant to each other should be grouped together in a topic. It's ok to only have 1 or 2 topic(s) if the dialogue is not very diverse.

Each topic should be summarized in 1-3 things discussed. Mention the names of specific persons.

The output format for each topic should strictly follow the following structure:
*{topic 1}*
- {1 thing discussed}
- {1 thing discussed}
- {1 thing discussed}

*{topic 2}*
- {1 thing discussed}
- {1 thing discussed}
- {1 thing discussed}

For example:
*Meeting to discuss LLMs*
- Aaron Wu shared details about accessing & trying out LLMs on the RC server
- Steps were provided for creating an account, creating a RC App, and uploading it to the server
- Peter Xu mentioned that CI workflow seems like a better idea than pre-commit hooks

*Fixing linting errors*
- Aaron Wu fixed most of the linting errors but encountered issues with UiKitModal file
- The file was found to be missing, so Aaron Wu disabled the linting errors and pushed the commit
- Jeffrey Yu can review the changes in PR #472

*Database Migration Plan Discussion*
- Bob suggested automating the rollback process for quick execution if needed
- The plan was updated to extend post-migration monitoring to two weeks
- Alice agreed with the updates and asked Bob to start working on data conversion scripts

- Testing and integrity checks are crucial to ensure data consistency.
- Post-migration monitoring is planned for one week to detect any issues.

*Risks and Mitigations*
- Data inconsistency during migration is a key risk, mitigated by thorough testing and checks.
- Extended downtime is another risk, mitigated by scheduling during low-traffic periods and having a rollback plan.
